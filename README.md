# HTTP-Server
Implemented our own version of HTTP stateless server and tested it using any standard browser.
On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. 
(for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web
On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. 
At a minimum, this is an ​HTTP server​. An HTTP server is software that understands ​URLs​ (web addresses) and 
​HTTP​ (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers 
the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. 
When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP server​ accepts the request, finds the requested document, and 
sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server.A static web server, or 
stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it "static" because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser.

This way we achieved the required task to complete about making a static http web server to host any html based documents in any web browser .
With the help of java ,socket programming , tcp/udp protocols and web drivers we created a webserver to host any html documents also known as websites .
